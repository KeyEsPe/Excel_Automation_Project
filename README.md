# Excel Automation – Pharma Inventory Workflow (Power Query)

This project automates weekly and monthly inventory reports used by batch prep and warehouse teams in a regulated pharmaceutical environment. The workflow converts raw system exports into clean, standardized, print-ready reports with a single **Refresh**.

## Overview
Raw exports from internal systems required manual editing: renaming/adding columns, sorting rows and preparing print-ready formatting. Using Power Query, I automated the entire process so that each report is now generated consistently, accurately and with minimal manual work.

## Features
- Standardized column names and layout  
- Automated sorting and column reordering  
- Additional calculated/helper columns  
- Print-ready formatting (borders, header/footer)  
- One-click refresh workflow  
- Supports multiple export types (labels, leaflets, raw stock, cartons)

## Impact
- Data transformation reduced from 15–30 minutes → **<2 seconds**  
- Full operator workflow (download → open → refresh → print) → **~1 minute**  
- Fully consistent format across all reports  
- Reduced error risk in GMP-relevant documentation  
- Faster weekly/monthly inventory cycles  
- Better traceability and audit readiness
